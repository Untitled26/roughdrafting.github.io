    <h3>Premise:</h3>
    <p><h4>Meet the Gang.</h4>
      
    Introduce a story about making real friendships and opening your life up to the people around you. <br>
    Thus I determined the type of character to surround this series around is a secluded, controlling, sarcastic logic obsessed monster named Lynn.<br>
    The series begins during move-in day of university. Where Lynn meets her roommate named Chloe, a codependent individual who lacks her own direction and has a deep need for close friendships and forming any kind of relationship with everone she meets- dragging Lynn into the world of friendships introducing us to the rest of the cast.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Taro - The dyslexic, TV obsessed, anxiety filled, artist</li>
      <li>Kate Taylor - The intimidating, nihilistic, loyal, survivalist</li>
      <li>Melissa - The responsible, Caring, all too altruistic, medic</li>
      <li>Jack - The ultra-expressive, Daring, immature, Rebel</li>
      <li>Elijah - The narcissistic, sarcastic, Competitive, Achievement Hunter</li>
      <li>Ken - The Heroic, courageous, Man of Justice</li>
    </ul>
    Together this band of dysfunctional teenagers face the world of Friendships, University, Society, Adulthood, Friends, Family, and Change.</p>
