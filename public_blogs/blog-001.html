    <h4>My first Entry</h4>
    <p>I remember, 2012, when I was 8 years old, 9 am in the morning I open up the family iPad 1 to watch a youtube video. Maybe Tobuscas or Maybe Eddsworld has a new animation... today, Youtube decided to show me none other than: RWBY trailer: Red. 
    
    Seeing Ruby swing around her slice slaughting dozens of Bayer wolves sparked an interest in me that would go dormant for a long time. But nonetheless, That trailer was my first experience with Monty's work, changing my life forever. 
    I still didnt know what I wanted to do with my life as tiny little piss baby 8 year old but, I knew: I wanted to make things. animations, code, games, stories of epic proportions.
    
    I never opened blender until I was like 12, when my dad gave me his old mac book pro. the first thing I attempted to make was Hazel- at this point in time monty had passed and season 4 had just been coming out. trying to first just jump into blender with no help or any kind of assistance... realizing i didnt know what the hell i was doing ending up with some 100k vertex monstrosity. 
    Alittle after that I didnt come back because I got addicted to League of legends; thinking my future was in that game. (It wasn't- I peaked Gold when I was 14). Covid I spent my days spamming minecraft and valorant, thinking my future was in valorant for alittle bit too.
    BUT, I came back when I was 18. 
    Looked at how my life has been and decided: I need to animate. I want to make a story of my own. So i created virtues of life, picked up the craft of writing at 19 and finally taking the time to learn blender. The entire 3d pipeline.
    Now that I am in my 20s with barely any time on my hands I need to implement efficiency and organization to speed up my work flow. Efficiency is what monty understood was important.
    Anyways, here I am today. about 2 month total expanding my blender abilities, 1 year of studying story writing, and I am glad I get to live the life I have. Sure I have little time, but I think I have enough to do everything. I am thankful, and I will do my due diligence to make something simply awesome. I hope you enjoy. Goodnight.
    
    I realize my process has been slow so i'll start blogging some jibber jabber from my notes from time to time. </p>
