    <h4>My first Entry</h4>
    <p>
    What I may need to understand are different types of people-
1. DISC
2. Meyer Brigg
3. Enneagram
4. Carl Jung - Archetypes
5. John Truby - Archetypes
6. Character psychologist
study people but dont force characters into these categories. Separate study from creation; it will reduce formulaic creation of following a character type. if you study and understand the character types first then different character will eventually come naturally, *because you understand them*. 

The true meaning behind someone's action is due to core beliefs. I believe this to be true so I will change the way I act. This one core belief has components which will be the messy string that is pulled per episode. I am hoping to have 64 to 128 episodes.

So I will make MY archetypes in my understanding. This is of pure studying and not character creation. I will study more, test against people and characters on TV until i follow understand motivations and possible arcs.

Writing is hard because understanding why we are the way we are is hard. It's understanding...
- people
- beliefs
- the process of change - conflict
- creativity
- execution 
- symbols and detail
- Themes
My problem is understanding different types of people; not just discovering them but understanding what they believe in. It is not of a psychology study- because that how a general populace thinks, i need specific peoples.

So the question then becomes, how do i approach the study of people... the study of archetypes. So i guess its a specific field of psychology- hehe.

this and themes; how can each one grow?

[[Carl Jung.On the Nature of the Psyche]] 

i was studying some of carl jung's notes and i realized... humans are fucking complicated- my job as a writer isn't to recreate a human being psychologist are still struggling to understand how we work. My job as a writer is to understand how to replicate it well. my job is much more of a showman kind of representation. i would describe the difference between character and human as the 2 dimensional reflection of a human being. Sure we can make characters super complex *when it matters*, and all this cool characterization... but at the end of the day you are not going to get that character close to what a real human being is like because a human being psyche is an entire study on its own. 

Slow Creative process Problems:
I am slow at making things. A lot of the time I will not like the object of my creation because the design or some piece of its creation does not scream... beauty. So what can I do? first of course build a great foundation on understanding characters and differenciations- thats to dive into for another time. but for now I think I need this!
Need:
- Do you even know your character enough? if not- move back down to foundation.
- What do you want this character to portray on the surface? what do you want them to be like at an interpersonal level? how will they change?
- Concept arting (fail faster, smash random button, exaggerate characteristics). You can't try super hard on that first design. get through multiple iterations of the character faster and keep trying some new element everytime.
Not any huge discovery, just realized i had been more focused on a one time design vs learning the technique and how to actually concept art, so thats one of my newest ventures.
